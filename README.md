# Real-Time Web Traffic Anomaly Monitoring Dashboard

##  Overview
This project implements a **near real-time web traffic monitoring system** that detects abnormal spikes or drops in website traffic using **statistical anomaly detection** and visualizes the results in **Power BI Desktop**.

The system simulates live website traffic, aggregates requests per minute, calculates anomaly scores using a **Z-score–based approach**, and exposes the data through a **Flask REST API**. Power BI Desktop consumes this API and updates visuals using **Auto Page Refresh**.

---

##  Problem Statement
Web platforms frequently experience unexpected traffic changes due to marketing campaigns, outages, or system issues. Without near real-time monitoring, these anomalies can go unnoticed, leading to delayed response and potential business impact.

**Objective:**  
Build a near real-time monitoring solution that continuously tracks website traffic and flags anomalies for faster operational awareness.
